# Thought Walker - Global Game Jam 2018
The theme for the game jam was Transmission. The game is 2D narrative horror/thriller where you play as a psychic detective. 

You need to move through different parts of an abandoned house trying to figure out 3 different voices and what happened to them. But something more dangerous lurks beneath the family's regular lives.
